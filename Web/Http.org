** why http has headers
   In simple terms physical systems using electrons, photons or electronmagnet waves need some way of marking the start of the data and end of data.
   Within the start and end headers they carry additional information such as lenght and a mechanism to detect any corruption of the data.
   For non physical system IP TCP HTTP the headers contain information (metadata) about the data.
